# Numerical Case of RSOME in Python

This document provides the code for numerical case studies presented in the paper *RSOME in Python: An Open-Source Package for Robust Stochastic Optimization Made Easy* and its online supplement. RSOME is an open-source Python package for modeling generic optimization problems in the presence of uncertainty. Resources of RSOME are listed below:
